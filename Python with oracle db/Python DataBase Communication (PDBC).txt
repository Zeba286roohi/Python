			  Python DataBase Communication (PDBC)
		================================================
=>Even we achieved the Data Persistency with Files concept, we have the following limitations.
1. Files Concept of any language does not contain security bcoz files            
    concept does not contain user names and passwords.
2. To extract  or process the data from files is very complex bcoz Files data 
     must always processed with Indices. 
3. The data of the files does not contain Column Names and Very complex to Process / Query  the data
4. Files are unable to store large Volume of Data.
5. The Architecture of Files Changes from One OS to another OS
     (OR ) Files are Dependent on OS.

=>To Overcome the limitations of Files, we must use the concept of DataBase Softwares Which are purely RDBMS Products(Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB,SQLITE3, DB2,SQL SERVER...........)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>When we Data Base Softwares for acheving the data persistency, we get the following advantages. 

	1. DataBase Softwares are Fully Secured bcoz they provides User Name and 
	    password
	2. To Process or Extract or Querying the data from DataBase Softwares is very     easy bcoz the data present in tables of Database softwares are qualified  with Column Names.
	3. Data Base Software are able to store large Volume of Data.
	4. Data Base Softwares are  InDepeendent from OS.
--------------------------------------------------------X------------------------------------------------------

=>If Python Program want to communicate with Any Database Software Product  then we must use pre-defined modules and such pre-defined modules are not present in Python Library. So that Python Programmer must  get / Install the pre-defined modules of Database Software by using a tool called pip.
=>To Make any Python Program to communicate with any data base software then we must install a third party module which is related Data base software.
=>For Example, To communicate with Oracle Database, we must install cx_Oracle Module, To communicate with MySQL data base , we must install mysql-connector.....etc and they must be installed explicitly by using pip tool

=>Syntax:     pip  install   module name

=>here pip tool present in the following folder
"C:\Users\nareshit\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts "

=>If we get an error as " pip is not recognized internal command " then set the path  as follows

C:\Users\nareshit>set path="C:\Users\nareshit\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts "


Example:    intsall  cx_Oracle
--------------
                   pip   install   cx_Oracle

Example:    install  mysql-connector

		pip  install   mysql-connector
