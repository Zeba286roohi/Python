			Anonymous  or Lambda  Functions
		===========================================
=>Anonymous Functions are those which does not contain any name explicitly.
=>The purpose of Anonymous Functions is that "To Peform Instant Operations".  
    Instant Operations are those which are no longer interested to carry in further programs.
=>Anonymous Functions contains single executable statement
=>Anonymous Functions automatically or implicitly returns the value(No Need to 
   use return statement to return the value).
=>To define Anonymous Functions, we use a key word "lambda" and hence 
    Anonymous Functions are called Lambda Functions.
------------------
=>Syntax:
------------------
		varname=lambda params-list : Expression
--------------------
Explanation:
--------------------
=>varname is an object of type of <class 'function'> and varname is itself indirectly     acts function name.
=>lambda is a keyword used for defining Anonymous Functions
=>Params-list represents list of variable names used for storing the input values 
   coming function calls.
=>Expression represents single executable statement and provides solution for Instant Operation.
