					1) filter()
		============================================
=>filter() is used for filtering out some elements from given list of elements by applying to given function.

=>Syntax:-
		varname=filter(Functionname,Iterable object)

Explanation:
-------------------
=>varname is an object of <class,'filter'> and we can convert into any iterable object type by using Ityerable type casting functions.
=>Function name can be either Normal function or anonymous function.
=>Iterable object can be sequence, list , set or dict type.
=>The execution process of filter() is that "Each element of Iterable object passing to specified function, the function decides True or False based on condtion,
 if the function returns True then the corresponding element will be filtered and if the function returns False then the corresponding element will be neglected (not filtered) " .
 This Process will be continued until all elements of iterable completed .
