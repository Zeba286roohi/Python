=>The purpose of Network Programming is that "To share the data between multiple machines".
--------------------------------
=>Def. of Network:
--------------------------------
=>A Network is a collection of Inter-connected computers connected with Server".
=>In Network programming, we have two write two types of Programs. They are

		1) Server Side Program
		2) Client Side Program
------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Server Side Program:
------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Server Side Program is of the Python Program, which receives the request from client side program, Process the Request and gives response back to Client Side Program.
------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Client Side Program:
------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A Client Side Program is of the Python Program,which always send request to the server side program and recives the response from server side Program
------------------------------------------------------------------
 DNS(Domain Naming Service)
------------------------------------------------------------------
=>A DNS is a Name of the Physical machine where Server Side Programs resides
=>The default DNS of every computer is "localhost"
------------------------------------------------------------------
 IP Address (Internet Protocol address)
------------------------------------------------------------------
=>An IP Address is one of the Numerical Address of the Physical Machine, where server side 
    program resides.
=>The default IP Address of every mchine is 127.0.0.1 (loop back address)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>port number:
--------------------------------------
=>A Port Number is a logical numerical id where server side program is running.
