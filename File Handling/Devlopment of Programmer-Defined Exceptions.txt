		==================================================
			Devlopment of Programmer-Defined Exceptions
		==================================================
=>These exceptions developed by Python Programmers and they are available in Python Project  and used by other python programmers and they are always used for dealing with Common Problems.
=>Some of the Common Problems are
		1) Attempting to enter Invalid PIN.
		2) Attempting Invalid User name or Password
		3) Attempting to withdraw more amount than available balance.
		4)Attempting to represent Invalid Pattern...etc

=>To Develop programmer-defined exceptions, we must follow the following steps

Step-1: Choose the Programmer_defined Class Name
Step-2: The Programmer-defined class must inherit from either Exception or BaseException ( Here 
             Exception or BaseExcetion are called base classes in exception handling)


Examples:    class  KvrDivisionError(Exception):pass
		       class  PinError(BaseException):pass
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hence, To develop any programmer-defined exceptions based applications, we must ensurer that there exist 3 phases. They are
			1) Development of Programmer-defined Exception sub class
			2) Development a Function which will hit programmer-defined exception
			3) development of main program for handling the exception.
